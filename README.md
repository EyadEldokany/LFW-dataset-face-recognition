# LFW Dataset Face Recognition Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing and building a classification model using the [Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) dataset, which contains images of faces collected from the web for studying the problem of face recognition in an unconstrained environment. The aim is to explore and understand the dataset through data analysis and then build a machine learning model that can classify these faces.

## Dataset
The LFW dataset contains over 13,000 labeled images of faces collected from the internet. The labels correspond to the name of the person in the image. Each image is labeled with the name of the individual pictured.

- **Number of classes**: Over 5,700 unique individuals.
- **Number of images**: 13,000+.
- **Purpose**: To train a classifier capable of recognizing individuals.

## Data Preprocessing
Before model training, we preprocess the dataset to make it suitable for machine learning:

1. **Image Resizing**: Resized all images to a fixed size.
2. **Normalization**: Scaled pixel values to the range [0, 1].
3. **Label Encoding**: Encoded class labels into numeric values.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Some key findings from the EDA performed on the dataset include:

- **Class Distribution**: The dataset is highly imbalanced, with many individuals having only a few images.
- **Image Characteristics**: Analyzed pixel intensity distributions, checked for missing or corrupted images, and visualized sample images.

## Model Training
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was used to classify the images. Key details:

1. **Architecture**: Built a custom CNN architecture involving convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
2. **Loss Function**: Cross-entropy loss was used due to the multi-class nature of the problem.
3. **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer was employed for training the model.
4. **Data Augmentation**: Applied data augmentation techniques to improve generalizability.

## Results
- **Confusion Matrix**: Displayed confusion matrices to visualize performance across different classes.
